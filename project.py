Data is sent to the server via POST requests, which are then parsed via PHP and stored to a MySQL table.  The status of the data can be updated via a custom made admin panel.  Whenever a request is made, an email is sent to alert the admin.  This project had its own standalone HTML wrapper, and enabled the admin to add several pages containing additional information.  Bookings were requested using a custom made calendar interface.'''
